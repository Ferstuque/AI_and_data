## Notebooks

### `LLM - GPT2 - Fine-Tuning - HuggingFace dataset.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a small pre-trained Language Model (LLM), specifically GPT-2, using a dataset from the Hugging Face Datasets library. **Designed for execution on Google Colab with GPU acceleration for enhanced performance.**

**Key aspects covered in the notebook:**

* **Google Colab Optimization:** Instructions and code snippets optimized for running seamlessly on Google Colab, including GPU utilization.
* **Dataset Loading:** Guidance on how to efficiently load a text-based dataset from the Hugging Face Hub within the Colab environment.
* **Model Loading:** Loading the pre-trained GPT-2 Small model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
* **Tokenization:** Preprocessing the text data using the appropriate tokenizer for GPT-2.
* **Fine-Tuning:** Implementing the fine-tuning process using the Transformers Trainer API, leveraging the GPU cluster available in Colab for faster training times.
* **Evaluation:** Analysis of the model's performance **before** fine-tuning on a specific task (e.g., text generation, next word prediction).
* **Post Fine-Tuning Analysis:** Evaluation of the model's performance **after** fine-tuning, highlighting the improvements or changes in its capabilities.
* **Comments and Explanations:** Detailed comments throughout the code explaining each step, the reasoning behind it, and considerations for running on Colab.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks in this repository, particularly the LLM fine-tuning notebook, it is **highly recommended** to use Google Colab to take advantage of its free GPU resources.

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** Navigate to the `LLM - GPT2 - Fine-Tuning - HuggingFace dataset.ipynb` file in this repository and click the "Open in Colab" button (if available on the platform you are viewing this README). Alternatively, you can upload the `.ipynb` file to your Google Drive and open it with Google Colaboratory.

2.  **Connect to a GPU:** Once the notebook is open in Colab, go to "Runtime" in the menu bar and select "Change runtime type." In the "Hardware accelerator" dropdown, choose "GPU." This will allocate a GPU to your Colab session, significantly speeding up the fine-tuning process.

3.  **Install Libraries (if necessary):** The notebook itself will likely contain code to install the required libraries. However, if you encounter any missing library errors, you can install them directly in the Colab notebook using `pip`:

    ```python
    !pip install transformers datasets accelerate evaluate bert-score nltk
    !pip install git-lfs
    ```

4.  **Follow the Notebook:** Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially, reading the comments and explanations to understand each step of the fine-tuning process.

## Usage

The primary notebook in this repository is designed to be self-contained and provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning GPT-2 on a Hugging Face dataset within the Google Colab environment. Simply open the notebook in Colab and execute the cells.
